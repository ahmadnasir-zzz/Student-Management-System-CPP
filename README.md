## 👨‍💻 About the Author
**Ahmad Nasir**
*Computer Science Student*

Hi there! 👋 I am a CS student passionate about learning low-level programming and system design.

I built this **Student Management System** as a semester project to challenge myself with C++ logic and file handling. While it is a console-based application, it represents a significant milestone in my coding journey.

* If you see ways to optimize my code (especially the sorting algorithms or memory management), please open an **Issue** or let me know.
* I am constantly learning, so any advice from experienced developers is highly approximated.

🌟 **If you find this code helpful for your own studies, please give the repo a star!**
